## What this fork changes

Everything here is built on santifer's work. My changes sit on top of it:

- Extra zero-token discovery providers, including BuiltIn Charlotte
- Fixes to the agentic-jobs card parser and Hacker News thread discovery
- A shared stealth configuration for all outbound Playwright launches
- Deep search, a third Explore surface in the web UI
- An opt-in `allow_bare_remote` location tier for portal scanning

Everything below this line is upstream's documentation, lightly edited to
point at this fork instead of the original.

## What Is This

Career-Ops ([career-ops.org](https://career-ops.org), also known as **careerops**) turns any AI coding CLI into a full job search command center. Instead of manually tracking applications in a spreadsheet, you get an AI-powered pipeline that:

- **Evaluates offers** with a structured A-F evaluation (five scoring dimensions feeding a holistic 1.0-5.0 score)
- **Generates tailored PDFs** -- ATS-optimized CVs customized per job description
- **Scans portals** automatically (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, company pages)
- **Processes in batch** -- evaluate 10+ offers in parallel with sub-agents
- **Tracks everything** in a single source of truth with integrity checks
- **Researches companies and finds the right person to contact** -- applications get you in the queue; research gets you a conversation

> **Important: This is NOT a spray-and-pray tool.** Career-ops is a filter -- it helps you find the few offers worth your time out of hundreds. The system strongly recommends against applying to anything scoring below 4.0/5. Your time is valuable, and so is the recruiter's. Always review before submitting.

Career-ops is agentic: whichever AI coding CLI you choose navigates career pages with Playwright, evaluates fit by reasoning about your CV vs the job description (not keyword matching), and adapts your resume per listing.

> **Heads up: the first evaluations won't be great.** The system doesn't know you yet. Feed it context -- your CV, your career story, your proof points, your preferences, what you're good at, what you want to avoid. The more you nurture it, the better it gets. Think of it as onboarding a new recruiter: the first week they need to learn about you, then they become invaluable.

Created by santifer, who used it to evaluate 740+ job offers, generate 100+ tailored CVs, and land a Head of Applied AI role. [Read the full case study](https://santifer.io/career-ops-system). This fork is my own build of that system; the track record above is his, not mine.

## Features

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auto-Pipeline**        | Paste a URL, get a full evaluation + PDF + tracker entry                                                                                 |
| **6-Block Evaluation**   | Role summary, CV match, level strategy, comp research, personalization, interview prep (STAR+R) -- plus a Block G posting-legitimacy check that flags scams and ghost jobs |
| **Interview Story Bank** | Accumulates STAR+Reflection stories across evaluations -- 5-10 master stories that answer any behavioral question                        |
| **Negotiation Scripts**  | Salary negotiation frameworks, geographic discount pushback, competing offer leverage                                                    |
| **ATS PDF Generation**   | Keyword-injected CVs with Space Grotesk + DM Sans design                                                                                 |
| **Cover Letter Generator** | Research-backed cover letters with keyword mirroring, four interactive angle prompts (why/problems/approach/tone), draft-in-chat approval gate, and A4 PDF via the same HTML + Playwright pipeline as CVs. Auto-drafts on every evaluation; complete and generate on demand via `/career-ops cover` |
| **Application Email Drafts** | Formal recruiter/referral/cold application emails from a report or pasted JD, with subject line, attachment checklist, source-backed fit points, and a profile-driven contact block. Draft-only -- career-ops never sends, submits, or clicks anything. |
| **Portal Scanner**       | 45+ companies pre-configured (Anthropic, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Retool, n8n...) + custom queries across Ashby, Greenhouse, Lever, Wellfound |
| **Batch Processing**     | Parallel evaluation with headless CLI workers (`claude -p` / `opencode run`)                                                             |
| **Dashboard TUI**        | Terminal UI to browse, filter, and sort your pipeline                                                                                    |
| **Human-in-the-Loop**    | AI evaluates and recommends, you decide and act. The system never submits an application -- you always have the final call               |
| **Pipeline Integrity**   | Automated merge, dedup, status normalization, health checks                                                                              |
| **Beyond the CV**        | Company research ([`deep`](modes/deep.md)) surfaces AI strategy, recent moves, engineering culture, and the angle your profile should take. Contact discovery ([`contacto`](modes/contacto.md)) identifies the hiring manager, recruiter, or team peer worth reaching out to and drafts a ≤300-character LinkedIn message tuned to each contact type. Formal application email drafts ([`email`](modes/email.md)) turn an evaluated report or pasted JD into a subject line, body, and attachment checklist without sending, submitting, or clicking anything. Applications get you in the queue; research gets you a conversation. |

## Quick Start

> **Installing this fork?** The `npx` installer below fetches the *upstream*
> release, not this fork. To get this fork, use the git clone steps.

**Fastest way to install upstream — one command:**

```bash
npx @santifer/career-ops init
```

> 💡 `npx` ships with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) — it runs the installer once,
> without installing anything globally. No Node yet? Install it first.
> (Already using a Claude Code / Gemini / Codex CLI? Then you already have it.)

This clones the latest release into `./career-ops` and installs dependencies. Then:

```bash
cd career-ops
claude   # or codex / qwen / opencode / agy / grok — open your AI CLI here
```

**On first launch, career-ops walks you through setup — your CV, profile and target roles — just by chatting. Nothing to edit by hand.**

<details>
<summary><b>Prefer to set it up manually? (git clone)</b></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LAR3labs/reqmancer.git
cd reqmancer && npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # only needed for PDF generation

# 2. Check setup
npm run doctor                     # Validates all prerequisites

# 3. Configure
cp config/profile.example.yml config/profile.yml  # Edit with your details
cp templates/portals.example.yml portals.yml       # Customize companies

# 4. Add your CV
# Create cv.md in the project root with your CV in markdown

# 5. Open your AI CLI in this directory
claude   # or codex / opencode / qwen / agy / grok

# Then ask your CLI to adapt the system to you:
# "Change the archetypes to backend engineering roles"
# "Translate the modes to English"
# "Add these 5 companies to portals.yml"
# "Update my profile with this CV I'm pasting"

# 6. Start using
# Paste a job URL or JD text to trigger auto-pipeline
# If your CLI supports slash commands, use /career-ops (or its CLI-specific alias)
# In Codex, ask for the same mode in plain language, e.g.:
# "Run the career-ops scan mode"
# "Run the career-ops pipeline mode for data/pipeline.md"
# "Run the career-ops pdf mode for the latest evaluated role"
# "Run the career-ops tracker mode and summarize the current statuses"
```

</details>

> **The system is designed to be customized by your AI coding CLI itself.** Modes, archetypes, scoring weights, negotiation scripts -- just ask it to change them. It reads the same files it uses, so it knows exactly what to edit.

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for the full setup guide, [docs/RUNNING_ON_A_BUDGET.md](docs/RUNNING_ON_A_BUDGET.md) for instructions on running career-ops cheaply using custom or local models, [docs/APPLY_AUTOFILL.md](docs/APPLY_AUTOFILL.md) for details on the ATS auto-fill flow, and [docs/FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md) for answers to common setup questions.

## Antigravity CLI Integration

Career-ops supports Antigravity CLI natively, the same way it supports Claude Code and OpenCode. All slash commands are available through the shared skill entrypoint, using the same `modes/*.md` evaluation logic.

Google has transitioned consumer Gemini CLI access to Antigravity CLI. `GEMINI.md` is now a no-op compatibility guard so Antigravity does not duplicate the full project instructions when it reads both `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md`.

### Native Antigravity CLI

```bash
# 1. Run in the career-ops directory
cd career-ops
agy

# 2. Use the unified /career-ops command with subcommands:
/career-ops "Senior AI Engineer at Anthropic..."
/career-ops pipeline
/career-ops scan
/career-ops pdf
/career-ops tracker
```

The skill is defined using the open standard in `.agents/skills/career-ops/SKILL.md` and symlinked/referenced for each supported CLI (e.g. `.claude/`, `.qwen/`, `.antigravitycli/`, `.grok/`).

## Codex Integration

Career-ops supports Codex through the same shared router, but the invocation model is different from CLIs that auto-register slash commands. For the full guide, see [docs/CODEX.md](docs/CODEX.md).

### Interactive Codex

```bash
cd career-ops
codex
```

Slash commands are not guaranteed in Codex. If `/career-ops` is unavailable, ask Codex to run the mode directly in plain language:

```text
Evaluate this JD with career-ops auto-pipeline: https://company.com/jobs/123
Run the career-ops scan mode and summarize new matches.
Run the career-ops pipeline mode for data/pipeline.md.
Run the career-ops pdf mode for the latest evaluated role.
Run the career-ops tracker mode and summarize the current statuses.
```

### One-shot Codex (`codex exec`)

```bash
codex exec "Evaluate this JD with career-ops auto-pipeline: https://company.com/jobs/123"
codex exec "Run career-ops scan mode in this repo and summarize new matches."
codex exec "Run career-ops pipeline mode for data/pipeline.md."
codex exec "Run career-ops pdf mode for the latest evaluated role."
codex exec "Run career-ops tracker mode and summarize the current statuses."
```

## Grok Build CLI Integration

Career-ops supports Grok Build CLI natively, the same way it supports Claude Code and OpenCode. `AGENTS.md` is auto-loaded as project rules, and all slash commands are available through the shared skill entrypoint.

### Native Grok Build CLI

```bash
# 1. Run in the career-ops directory
cd career-ops
grok

# 2. Use the unified /career-ops command with subcommands:
/career-ops "Senior AI Engineer at Anthropic..."
/career-ops pipeline
/career-ops scan
/career-ops pdf
/career-ops tracker
```

For headless batch workers, use `grok -p "prompt"` (add `--yolo` to auto-approve tool executions).

### Standalone Gemini API Script (No CLI install needed)

```bash
# 1. Get a free API key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env, set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Evaluate a job description
node gemini-eval.mjs "We are looking for a Senior AI Engineer..."
node gemini-eval.mjs --file ./jds/my-job.txt
node agent-inbox.mjs add "..."   # queue a request for the next session
npm run gemini:eval -- "JD text here"
```

> **Free tier:** Both options work without billing. Native CLI uses Google OAuth; the API script uses `gemini-2.5-flash` (15 RPM, 1M tokens/day free).

## Usage

Career-ops uses a shared command router. In CLIs that register slash commands, it looks like this:

```
/career-ops                → Show all available commands
/career-ops {paste a JD}   → Full auto-pipeline (evaluate + PDF + tracker)
/career-ops scan           → Scan portals for new offers
/career-ops pdf            → Generate ATS-optimized CV
/career-ops cover          → Cover letter generator (paste JD or /career-ops cover {slug})
/career-ops email          → Formal application email draft (draft-only; never sends, submits, or clicks)
/career-ops batch          → Batch evaluate multiple offers
/career-ops tracker        → View application status
/career-ops apply          → Fill application forms with AI
/career-ops pipeline       → Process pending URLs
/career-ops contacto       → Find hiring manager / recruiter / peer + draft a ≤300-char LinkedIn message per contact type
/career-ops deep           → Generate a structured 6-axis research prompt (AI strategy, recent moves, culture, challenges, competitors, candidate angle)
/career-ops training       → Evaluate a course/cert
/career-ops project        → Evaluate a portfolio project
```

Or just paste a job URL or description directly -- career-ops auto-detects it and runs the full pipeline.

In Codex, slash commands are not guaranteed. Use the same mode names in a prompt instead, or call them from `codex exec`.

## How It Works

```
You paste a job URL or description

## Pre-configured Portals

The scanner comes with **45+ companies** ready to scan and **19 search queries** across major job boards. Copy `templates/portals.example.yml` to `portals.yml` and add your own:

**AI Labs:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral, Cohere, LangChain, Pinecone
**Voice AI:** ElevenLabs, PolyAI, Parloa, Hume AI, Deepgram, Vapi, Bland AI
**AI Platforms:** Retool, Airtable, Vercel, Temporal, Glean, Arize AI
**Contact Center:** Ada, LivePerson, Sierra, Decagon, Talkdesk, Genesys
**Enterprise:** Salesforce, Twilio, Gong, Dialpad
**LLMOps:** Langfuse, Weights & Biases, Lindy, Cognigy, Speechmatics
**Automation:** n8n, Zapier, Make.com
**European:** Factorial, Attio, Tinybird, Clarity AI, Travelperk

**Job boards searched:** 21 provider modules cover ATS APIs, board-wide feeds, XML/RSS feeds, markdown feeds, and local parsers. See [Supported job boards](docs/SUPPORTED_JOB_BOARDS.md) for the full table.

By default `node scan.mjs` (a.k.a. `npm run scan`) trusts what each ATS feed returns. Some companies leave stale postings in their public API even after the role is closed, so those expired entries can leak into `pipeline.md`. Pass `--verify` to launch Playwright after the API pass and drop expired postings before they hit the pipeline:

```bash
node scan.mjs --verify          # zero-token discovery + Playwright liveness check
```

The verification is sequential and only runs against new offers (after dedup), so the cost stays bounded.

## Dashboard TUI

The built-in terminal dashboard lets you browse your pipeline visually:

```bash
npm run serve:dashboard   # launch the TUI
npm run build:dashboard   # optional: build the standalone binary
```

Features: 6 filter tabs, 4 sort modes, grouped/flat view, lazy-loaded previews, inline status changes.

There is also an **experimental web UI** (alpha, opt-in — nothing runs unless you start it): see [`web/README.md`](web/README.md).

## FAQ

**What is career-ops?**
career-ops is an open-source, CLI-agnostic job-search command center. It turns any AI coding CLI into a pipeline that evaluates job offers against your CV, generates ATS-tailored PDFs, finds the right person to contact, and tracks everything in one place — while you keep the final decision. It is the first reference implementation of the CareerOps Manifesto. More at [career-ops.org](https://career-ops.org).

**Can I run career-ops for free, or on a cheaper / local model?**
Yes. career-ops is CLI-agnostic and runs on free and local models — via OpenRouter free models, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — so you are not tied to a paid subscription. See [docs/RUNNING_ON_A_BUDGET.md](docs/RUNNING_ON_A_BUDGET.md) for the full setup.

**Which AI CLIs does career-ops work with?**
career-ops runs on any major AI coding CLI — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini / Antigravity, OpenCode, Grok, Qwen and more — through the open Agent Skill Standard, so it is never locked to a single vendor. Use the CLI you already have.

**How do I install career-ops on Windows?**
career-ops runs on Windows. If skills fail to load with a symlink error during install, the fix is in [docs/FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md). Full steps are in [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md).

**Does career-ops auto-apply to jobs for me?**
No. career-ops is a filter, not a spray-and-pray auto-applier. The AI evaluates, ranks and drafts; it can fill forms and navigate application pages, but it never submits or sends an application — the final click is always yours, after your review. That human-in-the-loop design is the whole point.

**Is career-ops free and open source?**
Yes. career-ops is free and open source, and for the candidate it always will be — it is the first reference implementation of the [CareerOps Manifesto](https://career-ops.org/manifesto). Read it, and if it says what you believe, sign it.
